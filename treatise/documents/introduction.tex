\chapter*{Introduction}

This is a collection of notes taken on real analysis. Part I covers the
fundamentals of real analysis. A large part of the notes on Part I comes from
reading through \cite{rudin1964principles}, with
supplementary notes coming from \cite{abbott2012understanding,guidotti_li}.

We make the convention that a \textbf{\textcolor{cblue}{blue}} word is
to be the defined term that will be used in this text, and a
\textbf{\textcolor{cpurple}{purple}} word is to be a synonym that may be found
in other treatments of the subject. Example:
\begin{define*}
    Let $f: X \to Y$. A point $x \in X \cap Y$ is said to be a
    \defterm{fixed point}, or \altdefterm{invariant point} of $f$, if
    $f(x) = x$.
